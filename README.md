# Course Project - Homepage
GitHub page for my Course Project for Mobile Application Development.

# Summary / Purpose
This is a project for my mobile application development class, which encompasses the basics of jQuery, CSS, and HTML development for mobile webpage apps.

# Site Map / Structure
The site map is as follows (currently):

Logo/Header

Side Panel (intended as quick navigation to the different sections of the homepage)

Homepage:
- About me (or equivalent)
- Favorites List (with fields for entry - webstorage)
- Picture Grid (with 5 columns)
- Comments Form (with fields for comments on the site - webstorage)

Footer/Copyright

# User Interaction / Overall Flow

User Interaction:
- Mainly clicking on various buttons and links to navigate to different pages within the application. The intention was to make the interaction as straightforward and seamless as possible to keep the overall experience neat and tidy
- The buttons are designed to do exactly as they say, such as the back button taking the user to the pervious page and the side panel button opening the side panel when clicked/tapped

Overall Flow:
- Centered around the homepage and side panel for navigation to the various pages
- Buttons will generally take you to their intended pages or back to the homepage
- Bells and whistles kept to a minimum to avoid distractions from the main content
